# CS210-Project
CS210 Project by Osman Enes ErdoÄŸdu
This project based on the (as data) the movies I've beening watching for the last 3 years.
It consist name of the movies, the year I've watched, genre of the film, IMDB rank/score, studio/distributor, director of the film and the release of the film.
I have been recording the movies to my personal excel file. So at the beginning I loaded that. Then I displayed the first 10 rows to show an example how the data looks like.
I checked the data types and if any value is missing or not. This part is data cleaning and preprocessing.
Then I did some data analysis and exploration (EDA). Also there is visualization after them so that it can be more understandable.
